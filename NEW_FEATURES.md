# MSEC Connect - Enhanced Booking System

## 🚀 New Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Priority System with Auto-Approval**

#### **Priority Levels:**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes (server.js)**

#### **New API Endpoints:**
```javascript
GET /api/venues                    // Get all venues with capacities
GET /api/venues/recommend/:count   // Get recommended venues for attendee count
```

#### **Enhanced Booking Logic:**
```javascript
// Priority-based auto-approval
if (user.role === 'secretary' || user.role === 'principal') {
    status = 'confirmed';
    approvedBy = 'auto-approved';
} else if (user.role === 'hod' || user.role === 'staff') {
    status = 'pending'; // Requires admin approval
}
```

#### **Admin Approval Tracking:**
```javascript
// When admin approves a booking
updateFields = {
    status: 'confirmed',
    approvedBy: req.user.email,
    approvalDate: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

### **Database Schema Updates (models.js)**

#### **New Booking Fields:**
```javascript
purposeCategory: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    enum: ['Alumni Talk', 'Workshop', 'Seminar', 'Events', 'Other']
},
venueCapacity: Number,
approvedBy: String,      // Email of approving admin
approvalDate: String     // Approval timestamp
```

### **Frontend Changes (book.html)**

#### **Enhanced Form Elements:**
1. **Attendee Input**: Number input with real-time venue recommendations
2. **Venue Recommendations**: Dynamic list showing suitable venues
3. **Purpose Category**: Dropdown selection for event types
4. **Purpose Description**: Detailed text area for purpose

#### **Smart Venue Selector:**
```javascript
// Real-time recommendations as user types attendee count
attendeesInput.addEventListener('input', function() {
    const attendees = parseInt(this.value);
    if (attendees > 0) {
        showVenueRecommendations(attendees);
    }
});
